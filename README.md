I am in the process of uploading all the code for our baseline experiments. It also requires a lot of indexed tweet data that is much bigger than the data used for our experiments. Hence, the delay. If you are interested in using our data, please reach out by email so that we can share the data with you.

Please reach out to rpujari AT purdue DOT edu if have any questions.
